Created: Summer/Fall 2014

Plays MP3 and WAV files. 
Code writen by me, some methods for implementation gotten from stackoverflow (and other sites), Java and JavaFX API
Eclipse was used to help generate methods and for descriptions of some Java methods. 

Program was made to see/test methods and combine more concepts together (in various ways) than to make actual deployable code. While the program does as intended please check the known issues document for things that would need significant improvement.
